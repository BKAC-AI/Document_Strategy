## Deflect customer support and reduce engineering escalations
Aligning your team on strategic docs work requires syncing people and processes, leveraging appropriate tools, and ensuring fast feedback channels are available. Fluent, trusting relationships between the doc team and stakeholders in product, customer relations, and dev teams is critical to the success of a documentation strategy that delights customers and reduces burden on support teams. 

Let's look at the *when, where, who, and how*.
# When
The best time to catch a problem is before it happens. While that's not always possible, great relationships and a pro-active customer focus can help reduce likelihood of issues arising.
## Pre-mortem
6 months from now, if we do nothing differently, what is driving our support issues and escalations? 
 - Which issues are the most costly in terms of time, retention, or reputation?
 - Which issues, while small, are the most common?
 - Where are there breaks or bottlenecks in our feedback mechanisms or processes?
## Before
Stay on top of feature release roadmaps, planning discussions to know what new features are coming down the pipeline.
 - Does it have the potential to break users existing workflows?
 - Does it require changing existing workflows?
 - What new benefits does it bring?
 - Is it an improvement that's essentially a "no-op" for the user?
## During
What mechanisms are in place for monitoring support requests and escalations? 
 - Loop the doc team into service ticket systems.
 - Build in a "documentation fix" flag if appropriate.

## People

Ensuring good, close working relationships between product, support, and doc teams is essential. If there is trust between teams, good things happen quickly and easily:

- Product teams are more likely to proactively communicate with doc teams about upcoming changes
- Support teams are not shy to correct and inform doc teams about what they need
- Customer relations folks involve doc team in creating successful experiences for users.

## Processes
Methods for communicating changes, issues, and successes need to be as seamless as possible.


# Assessment
What's the current state?
What's working?
What's really broken?
What's working that could be improved by 1% or more?
What would success look like?
What data do we have? 
What data do we need?
## Priorities
What are the key problems we need to solve?
Which issues cause the most pain to customers? To support teams? To dev rel teams? To management?
Are we aligned with stakeholders about what matters most?
## Actions
What actions can we take immediately?
What groundwork do we need to put in place for the future?
